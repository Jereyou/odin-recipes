    <h2>Why This Burger?</h2>
    <p1>Have you ever just woke up and craved a burger?</p1>
    <p2>Well do I have a recipe for you, with this reciper not only will you make a perfect burger but also satisfy that craving!</p2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>1 pound ground beef (85% lean 15%)</li>
        <li>2 teaspooons avocado oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sea salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup whiskey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol><li>We hands and form 2(8 ounce) burgers; place on a plate covered and leave in the fridge till grilling time.</li>
    <li>Start getting you charcoal fired up, if you'd like throw in some mesquite or hickory wood. The coals should be glwoing red and blasting extreme heat before the meat hits the grill.</li>
    <li>Rub the burgers with olive and coat with sea salt until the entire surface is covered.</li>
    <li>Pour your choice of whiskey into a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
    <li>Transfer the burger into the bowl of whiskey and turn them constantly for 1 minute.(Most of the salt will come off, which is completely fine)</li>
    <li>Place the burger in the hotest spot of the grill and sear both sides for 2 minutes. Occasionally you can baste the burger with a small amount of whiskey while searing.</li>
    <li>Remember that soy sauce we had, we're going to add some to a shallow bowl and turn constantly for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>After that return the burger to the hottest spot again. Grill each side until the desired doneness. For medium rare use an instant-read thermometer; insert it in the center and if it read 125 to 130 F, you have the perfect medium rare burger.
        If you want a more cooked burger move the burger to a side that isn't as hot and leave it there to your desired doneness.</li>
    <li>Garnish how you like, and BOOM you have the perfect burger with a nice smokey whiskey taste to it.</li>
